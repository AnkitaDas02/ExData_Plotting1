First Project for the Course - Exploratory Data Analysis

The aim here is to practice the analyses methods covered during week 1 of the course. The dataset used for creating graphs is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets.It contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. 

For this project, graphs were created as per the picture provided.

The repo contains R script and png of the plots built along with R script which is used for importing and preparing data for the graphs.
